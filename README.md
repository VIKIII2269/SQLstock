## Overview

The notebook in this repository is designed to facilitate the analysis of stock market data, particularly focusing on:

- Loading and cleaning raw stock data.
- Converting and formatting date columns.
- Selecting relevant columns for analysis.
- Setting up the data for time series analysis or prediction.

This project can be expanded to include various machine learning models for predicting future stock prices or trends based on historical data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `sqlalchemy`, `psycopg2` (for PostgreSQL integration)

### Install Required Packages

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy psycopg2
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-prediction.git
   cd stock-market-prediction
   ```

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook cleaned_stockprediction.ipynb
   ```

3. **Run the Cells**:
   Follow the notebook's cells to load, preprocess, and analyze stock market data.

## Data Preprocessing

The notebook includes steps to:

- **Select Columns**: Focuses on the `date`, `open`, and `close` columns.
- **Convert Data Types**: Converts the `date` column to a `datetime` format.
- **Set Index**: Uses the `date` column as the DataFrame index.

These steps prepare the data for further analysis, such as time series modeling.

## Database Integration

The notebook includes optional integration with a PostgreSQL database, allowing you to:

- **Pull Data from PostgreSQL**: Load data directly from a PostgreSQL database.
- **Send Processed Data Back**: Insert or update processed data back into the database.

Example code snippets for connecting to a PostgreSQL database are provided in the notebook.
